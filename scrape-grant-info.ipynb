       "2  Initial request for (or the award of) additional funds during a current project period to support new or additional activities that are not identified in the current award. This request reflects an expansion of the scope of the grant-approved activities. Competitive revisions require peer review. (Competing revision replaces the previous NIH term, \"competing supplement.\") An administrative supplement is a request for (or the award of) additional funds during a current project period to provide for an increase in costs due to unforeseen circumstances. All additional costs must be within the scope of the peer reviewed and approved project.  \n",
